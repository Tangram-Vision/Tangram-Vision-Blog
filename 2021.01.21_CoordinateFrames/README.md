# Coordinate Frames

This code was used to create the figures found in the series "Coordinate Frames", which dealt with methods to transition
between spatial frames of reference.

## Installation

```
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/tangram
source ~/.venv/tangram/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the code in isolation, we use iPython:

```
ipython --matplotlib=qt
In [1]: %run CoordinateFrames.py
```
